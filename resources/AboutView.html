<h1>Disclaimer:</h1>
<p>This application is not affiliated with the City of Winston-Salem or the City of Winston-Salem Police Department.</p>
<p>We use <a href="http://www.wspdp2c.org">publicly available</a> information to generate the map and pinpoints of <em>reported</em> police incidents, crime, and arrests. Any errors, omissions, incorrect point placement, etc. are a result of the <em>reported</em> data. Sometimes sensitive locations are not fully reported (such as offenses committed by minors or sensitive calls like attempted suicides, sexual assault, etc.). Some names of arrestees are not reported in certain instances as well.</p>
<p>This application does not display traffic citation arrests since they are not included in the data set from the city.</p>

<h1>Enhancements to Data:</h1>
<p>Sometimes an officer is called to an incident and an arrest is made. This generates both an incident and an arrest pin on the map.<br />
We attempt to clean this data so that <em>only</em> the arrest pin is shown by attempting to match up time, location, and the reported offense. This method is not 100% reliable so there may be duplicate data as reported by the City of Winston-Salem.</p>
<p>We also make minor adjustments to the pin locations when there is a lot of activity in one location (take the downtown courthouse, for example). This is a convenience to you so that the pinpoints are not stacked on top of each other on the map.</p>
